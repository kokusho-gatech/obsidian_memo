In this tutorial, we‚Äôll build a simple MCP weather server and connect it to a host, Claude for Desktop. We‚Äôll start with a basic setup, and then progress to more complex use cases.

### What we‚Äôll be building

Many LLMs do not currently have the ability to fetch the forecast and severe weather alerts. Let‚Äôs use MCP to solve that!We‚Äôll build a server that exposes two tools: `get_alerts` and `get_forecast`. Then we‚Äôll connect the server to an MCP host (in this case, Claude for Desktop):![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/weather-alerts.png) ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/current-weather.png)

Servers can connect to any client. We‚Äôve chosen Claude for Desktop here for simplicity, but we also have guides on [building your own client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client) as well as a [list of other clients here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

### Core MCP Concepts

MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:
1. **Resources**: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)
2. **Tools**: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
3. **Prompts**: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks
This tutorial will primarily focus on tools.

Let‚Äôs get started with building our weather server! [You can find the complete code for what we‚Äôll be building here.](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/tree/main/weather-server-python)

### Prerequisite knowledge

This quickstart assumes you have familiarity with:
- Python
- LLMs like Claude

### Logging in MCP Servers

When implementing MCP servers, be careful about how you handle logging:**For STDIO-based servers:** Never write to standard output (stdout). This includes:
- `print()` statements in Python
- `console.log()` in JavaScript
- `fmt.Println()` in Go
- Similar stdout functions in other languages
Writing to stdout will corrupt the JSON-RPC messages and break your server.**For HTTP-based servers:** Standard output logging is fine since it doesn‚Äôt interfere with HTTP responses.

### Best Practices

1. Use a logging library that writes to stderr or files.

### Quick Examples

```
# ‚ùå Bad (STDIO)

print("Processing request")

# ‚úÖ Good (STDIO)

import logging

logging.info("Processing request")
```

### System requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher installed.
- You must use the Python MCP SDK 1.2.0 or higher.

### Set up your environment

First, let‚Äôs install `uv` and set up our Python project and environment:

```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Make sure to restart your terminal afterwards to ensure that the `uv` command gets picked up.Now, let‚Äôs create and set up our project:

```
# Create a new directory for our project

uv init weather

cd weather

# Create virtual environment and activate it

uv venv

source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies

uv add "mcp[cli]" httpx

# Create our server file

touch weather.py
```

Now let‚Äôs dive into building your server.

## Building your server

### Importing packages and setting up the instance

Add these to the top of your `weather.py`:

```
from typing import Any

import httpx

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Initialize FastMCP server

mcp = FastMCP("weather")

# Constants

NWS_API_BASE = "https://api.weather.gov"

USER_AGENT = "weather-app/1.0"
```

The FastMCP class uses Python type hints and docstrings to automatically generate tool definitions, making it easy to create and maintain MCP tools.

### Helper functions

Next, let‚Äôs add our helper functions for querying and formatting the data from the National Weather Service API:

### Implementing tool execution

The tool execution handler is responsible for actually executing the logic of each tool. Let‚Äôs add it:

```
@mcp.tool()

async def get_alerts(state: str) -> str:

    """Get weather alerts for a US state.

    Args:

        state: Two-letter US state code (e.g. CA, NY)

    """

    url = f"{NWS_API_BASE}/alerts/active/area/{state}"

    data = await make_nws_request(url)

    if not data or "features" not in data:

        return "Unable to fetch alerts or no alerts found."

    if not data["features"]:

        return "No active alerts for this state."

    alerts = [format_alert(feature) for feature in data["features"]]

    return "\n---\n".join(alerts)

@mcp.tool()

async def get_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float) -> str:

    """Get weather forecast for a location.

    Args:

        latitude: Latitude of the location

        longitude: Longitude of the location

    """

    # First get the forecast grid endpoint

    points_url = f"{NWS_API_BASE}/points/{latitude},{longitude}"

    points_data = await make_nws_request(points_url)

    if not points_data:

        return "Unable to fetch forecast data for this location."

    # Get the forecast URL from the points response

    forecast_url = points_data["properties"]["forecast"]

    forecast_data = await make_nws_request(forecast_url)

    if not forecast_data:

        return "Unable to fetch detailed forecast."

    # Format the periods into a readable forecast

    periods = forecast_data["properties"]["periods"]

    forecasts = []

    for period in periods[:5]:  # Only show next 5 periods

        forecast = f"""

{period['name']}:

Temperature: {period['temperature']}¬∞{period['temperatureUnit']}

Wind: {period['windSpeed']} {period['windDirection']}

Forecast: {period['detailedForecast']}

"""

        forecasts.append(forecast)

    return "\n---\n".join(forecasts)
```

### Running the server

Finally, let‚Äôs initialize and run the server:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Initialize and run the server

    mcp.run(transport='stdio')
```

Your server is complete! Run `uv run weather.py` to confirm that everything‚Äôs working.Let‚Äôs now test your server from an existing MCP host, Claude for Desktop.

## Testing your server with Claude for Desktop

Claude for Desktop is not yet available on Linux. Linux users can proceed to the [Building a client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client) tutorial to build an MCP client that connects to the server we just built.

First, make sure you have Claude for Desktop installed. [You can install the latest version here.](https://claude.ai/download) If you already have Claude for Desktop, **make sure it‚Äôs updated to the latest version.**We‚Äôll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn‚Äôt exist.For example, if you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed:

```
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

You‚Äôll then add your servers in the `mcpServers` key. The MCP UI elements will only show up in Claude for Desktop if at least one server is properly configured.In this case, we‚Äôll add our single weather server like so:

```
{

  "mcpServers": {

    "weather": {

      "command": "uv",

      "args": [

        "--directory",

        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather",

        "run",

        "weather.py"

      ]

    }

  }

}
```

You may need to put the full path to the `uv` executable in the `command` field. You can get this by running `which uv` on MacOS/Linux or `where uv` on Windows.

Make sure you pass in the absolute path to your server.

This tells Claude for Desktop:
1. There‚Äôs an MCP server named ‚Äúweather‚Äù
2. To launch it by running `uv --directory /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/weather run weather.py`
Save the file, and restart **Claude for Desktop**.

### Test with commands

Let‚Äôs make sure Claude for Desktop is picking up the two tools we‚Äôve exposed in our `weather` server. You can do this by looking for the ‚ÄúSearch and tools‚Äù icon:![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/visual-indicator-mcp-tools.png) After clicking on the slider icon, you should see two tools listed:![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/available-mcp-tools.png) If your server isn‚Äôt being picked up by Claude for Desktop, proceed to the [Troubleshooting](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/#troubleshooting) section for debugging tips.If the tool settings icon has shown up, you can now test your server by running the following commands in Claude for Desktop:
- What‚Äôs the weather in Sacramento?
- What are the active weather alerts in Texas?
![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/current-weather.png) ![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mcp/images/weather-alerts.png)

Since this is the US National Weather service, the queries will only work for US locations.

## What‚Äôs happening under the hood

When you ask a question:
1. The client sends your question to Claude
2. Claude analyzes the available tools and decides which one(s) to use
3. The client executes the chosen tool(s) through the MCP server
4. The results are sent back to Claude
5. Claude formulates a natural language response
6. The response is displayed to you!

## Troubleshooting

**Getting logs from Claude for Desktop** Claude.app logging related to MCP is written to log files in `~/Library/Logs/Claude`:
- `mcp.log` will contain general logging about MCP connections and connection failures.
- Files named `mcp-server-SERVERNAME.log` will contain error (stderr) logging from the named server.
You can run the following command to list recent logs and follow along with any new ones:

```
# Check Claude's logs for errors

tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
```

**Server not showing up in Claude**
1. Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file syntax
2. Make sure the path to your project is absolute and not relative
3. Restart Claude for Desktop completely
**Tool calls failing silently** If Claude attempts to use the tools but they fail:
1. Check Claude‚Äôs logs for errors
2. Verify your server builds and runs without errors
3. Try restarting Claude for Desktop
**None of this is working. What do I do?**Please refer to our [debugging guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/debugging) for better debugging tools and more detailed guidance.

**Error: Failed to retrieve grid point data** This usually means either:
1. The coordinates are outside the US
2. The NWS API is having issues
3. You‚Äôre being rate limited
Fix:
- Verify you‚Äôre using US coordinates
- Add a small delay between requests
- Check the NWS API status page
**Error: No active alerts for \[STATE\]** This isn‚Äôt an error - it just means there are no current weather alerts for that state. Try a different state or check during severe weather.
